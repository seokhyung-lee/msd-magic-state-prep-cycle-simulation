# msd-magic-state-prep-cycle-simulation
Python code for simulating the magic state preparation cycle of a cultivation + distillation scheme from arXiv:2409.07707.

Use the function `simulate_msd()` to perform the simulation. By default, it returns the average interval between two consecutive rounds and the average idling time of each magic state after generation.

See the function's docstring and [arXiv:2409.07707](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07707) for more details.
